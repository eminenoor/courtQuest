We discussed on the topic of the Project.

17 June - 23 June
We discussed which technologies we would be using.

24 June - 30 June
We started our requirements presentation. Elif and I researched similar applications and discussed which functionalities we wanted to implement or exclude in CourtQuest. Elif also researched optional technologies, and we deliberated on the most suitable technologies to use. I added the slides for the “similar applications” section, which Can and İlke edited later.

1 July - 7 July
We wrote our requirements report. I wrote the "similar applications" part. We started on our UI Design.

8 July - 14 July
For UI Design, we initially discussed which functionalities required their own pages and
continued our design from there. During the requirements report stage, we all contributed to
ensuring the design provided the most user-friendly interface. I created the sign-in, register,
and invite players pages using Uizard, based on İlke’s drawings. Additionally, I contributed to
the storyboard and activity design panels. For the presentation, I helped export designs from the Uizard site and edited the presentation slides. I presented the main page, the “my activities” page, and the sidebar menu.

15 July - 21 July
In the UI Design report, I wrote the parts for Main Page, My Activities Page, Sidebar Menu and Make a Reservation Page. And we started to discuss our implementation. 

22 July - 28 July
We started our implementation. I started to write the entities, services, repositories, and controllers. We wrote our detailed design report. ı wrote the parts for controllers and repositories.

29 July - 4 August
I connected notification view to backend, and request's accept and decline part. I directed the team with the usage of github. I merged the frontend repository with the backend repository. We finalized the code. İlke and I prepared the demo slides.
