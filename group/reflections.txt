This project was a useful and improving learning experience for us. We learned many things like how to use Spring Boot. We learned how databases work and learned to connect our database to the application. We learned to integrate authentication to our app. Overall, we learned how to make a web application.There were some difficulties when we were implementing the project.For example, implementing the “login” part was difficult for us. At first, we could not manage to work it out, so it was hard to continue with other parts of the project. However, later with more research we fixed the problem and continued with implementing our functionalities. Also, we disliked the part where we merged our codes and it was hard for us to commit at the same time. Sometimes, there were some conflicts in our code, we had to combine them via Github. Since we are not used to using Github, that was a difficult aspect for us. If we had to start over again, we mostly would not change anything. We are happy with what we have done. However, we could have researched more on some topics and started implementation earlier.
We spent 1.5 - 2 weeks on the implementation of the project. However, the whole process was longer. We had to think about an idea for the project. We decided on how we could implement the application and what technologies we could use. Also, we spent a considerable amount of time designing the user interface. Plus, before we started the implementation, we researched some ideas, tools and how we could integrate them into our project. Therefore, throughout the process, we learned these tools and put our ideas into practice. Overall we spent 4 - 5 weeks on the project. Indeed, we are proud of what we have achieved. Even though we faced some obstacles in this journey, the final product satisfied us and we learned some tools, libraries, and frameworks. Therefore, this project contributed to our group and learning skills.
